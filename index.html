      <h1>To Yingxin</h1>
      <ul>
        <li>9/26/18 a reader vs a writer. A viewer vs an actor. If possible, I would prefer to be a reader or a viewer.</li>
        <li>9/25/18 Another <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=53h2dbMKV34">song</a> into my album.</li>
        <li>9/24/18 每天愛穎欣多一點.</li>
        <li>9/23/18 聽了好多遍，還想聽. Happy mid-autumn festival to both of us.</li>
        <li><audio controls src="./你的心就是我的家_20180923.mp3"> Your browser does not support the <code>audio</code> element.</audio></li>
        <li>9/19/18 - 9/22/18 忽略難過的日子.</li>
        <li>9/18/18 I need to focus more on academics. No one wants to be mediocre, and love 颖欣 at the same time.</li>
        <li>9/17/18 It is difficult to find a good engagement ring.</li>
        <li>9/16/18 Finally, my parents know about 颖欣.</li>
        <li>9/15/18 我要学会保护自己</li>
        <li>9/14/18 被无视了， 吃力不讨好， 很难过</li>
        <li>9/13/18 Not happy today. Slept earlier.</li>
        <li>9/12/18 Am I overcommitted to this relationship? I am confused.</li>
        <li>9/11/18 It's difficult to balance relationship and study, especially for a novice like me.</li>
        <li>9/10/18 Fortunately, Yingxin is recovered without any fever. Relieved.</li>
        <li>9/09/18 Yingxin is sick today, and I am really worried.</li>
        <li>9/08/18 No one is perfect. We all have flaws. I love you, as always.</li>
        <li>9/07/18 Today is a very special date for me. Happy Birthday, my love. I never spent so much time to prepare for others' birthday, not even my parents'. In fact, I never even have any chance to celebrate my own birthday, but still I am very happy today.</li>
        <li>9/06/18 Tomorrow is Yingxin's birthday. I need to publish this webpage today.</li>
        <li>9/05/18 I don't want Yingxin to worry about me so I slept early today. </li>
        <li>9/04/18 Yingxin told me to drink more water, and I did drink a lot of water today.</li>
        <li>9/03/18 made a video of me walking from Chinatown to home. Yingxin seems to like it.</li>
        <li>9/02/18 I hope that Yingxin can find a better job in the future, and doesn't need to work for long hours. I feel terrible when Yingxin has to work for 10 hours a day.</li>
        <li>9/01/18 I brought a gift for Yingxin's upcoming birthday, and went to the post office. It's late to send it to Macau by 09/07/2018. Damn it. I should plan ahead next year.</li>
        <li>8/31/18 Yingxin went to hospital today, and I am worried. Hopefully, everything will be fine.</li>
        <li>8/30/18 Doesn't have time to talk to Yingxin, too busy today. Hope that she can understand me.</li>
        <li>8/29/18 yirongandyingxinforerve -> 溢荣颖欣一生一世.</li>
        <li>8/28/18 Very tired at school today, but Yingxin always gives me energy and cheers me up!</li>
        <li>8/27/18 connected to Yingxin's sister in Facebook. More opportunity to know Yingxin more.</li>
        <li>8/26/18 talked to Yingxin in wechat for 276 min and 47s. Very satisfied!</li>
        <li>8/25/18 经过考验的爱情更加珍贵.</li>
        <li>8/24/18 Not a very pleasant day for both of us.</li>
        <li>8/23/18 I am starting to develop and maintain this website for Yingxin. Excited!</li>
