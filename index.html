      <h1>To Yingxin</h1>
      <ul>
        <li>9/09/18 Yingxin is sick today, and I am really worried.</li>
        <li>9/08/18 No one is perfect. We all have flaws. I love you, as always.</li>
        <li>9/07/18 Today is a very special date for me. Happy Birthday, my love. I never spent so much time to prepare for others' birthday, not even my parents'. In fact, I never even have any chance to celebrate my own birthday, but still I am very happy today.</li>
        <li>9/06/18 Tomorrow is Yingxin's birthday. I need to publish this webpage today.</li>
        <li>9/05/18 I don't want Yingxin to worry about me so I slept early today. </li>
        <li>9/04/18 Yingxin told me to drink more water, and I did drink a lot of water today.</li>
        <li>9/03/18 made a video of me walking from Chinatown to home. Yingxin seems to like it.</li>
        <li>9/02/18 I hope that Yingxin can find a better job in the future, and doesn't need to work for long hours. I feel terrible when Yingxin has to work for 10 hours a day.</li>
        <li>9/01/18 I brought a gift for Yingxin's upcoming birthday, and went to the post office. It's late to send it to Macau by 09/07/2018. Damn it. I should plan ahead next year.</li>
        <li>8/31/18 Yingxin went to hospital today, and I am worried. Hopefully, everything will be fine.</li>
        <li>8/30/18 Doesn't have time to talk to Yingxin, too busy today. Hope that she can understand me.</li>
        <li>8/29/18 yirongandyingxinforerve -> 溢荣颖欣一生一世.</li>
        <li>8/28/18 Very tired at school today, but Yingxin always gives me energy and cheers me up!</li>
        <li>8/27/18 connected to Yingxin's sister in Facebook. More opportunity to know Yingxin more.</li>
        <li>8/26/18 talked to Yingxin in wechat for 276 min and 47s. Very satisfied!</li>
        <li>8/25/18 经过考验的爱情更加珍贵.</li>
        <li>8/24/18 Not a very pleasant day for both of us.</li>
        <li>8/23/18 I am starting to develop and maintain this website for Yingxin. Excited!</li>
